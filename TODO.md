Here is a list of things that could be nice
===========================================

- other order filters: random, first, last, maybe some () to parametrize digest
- image inliner
- seen filter
- embedded scripting language for filters&manipulation
- include date in digest or not
- remove tags for instagram
- filter on language
- see whatever feature from rss2email we would like to import
- change the wikipedia filter to be able to remove words/sentences from a file like: removewords(test.txt)
